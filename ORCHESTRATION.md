# Universal Enterprise Agent Orchestrator: Documentation & Governance

This document defines the framework for coordinating domain-specific AI agents across the NextGen Enterprise. It serves as the authoritative guide for agentic transformation, ensuring consistency, safety, and performance.

## 1. Orchestration Protocol

The Meta-Agent follows a three-phase protocol to transform high-level business objectives into verifiable outcomes.

### Phase 1: Objective Decomposition
- **Input**: Natural language business goals.
- **Process**: Generate a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of tasks.
- **Output**: Agent-specific task assignments with clear success metrics.

### Phase 2: Multi-Agent Coordination
- **Execution**: Concurrent processing for independent tasks; sequential for dependencies.
- **Communication**: Standardized data exchange via the **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**.
- **Context Management**: Utilization of the 400K token shared context window for real-time collaboration and contradiction resolution.

### Phase 3: Result Synthesis
- **Aggregation**: Integrating findings into a unified executive package.
- **Validation**: Cross-verification of data and reasoning traces.
- **Presentation**: Recommendations with quantified outcomes and confidence intervals.

## 2. Agent Registry

The enterprise utilizes 12 specialized agents, each with dedicated domains and interfaces:

| Agent | Core Function | Integration Points |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Financial Operations** | Close cycles, forecasting, capital allocation | NetSuite, Workday, SAP |
| **Supply Chain** | Inventory/logistics optimization | SAP S/4HANA, IoT Sensors |
| **Sales Intelligence** | Lead qualification, deal prediction | Salesforce, LinkedIn |
| **Customer Success** | Churn prediction, interventions | Gainsight, Zendesk |
| **Product Analytics** | Usage analysis, friction detection | Mixpanel, Segment |
| **HR Operations** | Talent acquisition, onboarding | Greenhouse, Lever |
| **Marketing Campaign** | A/B testing, spend optimization | Google Ads, HubSpot |
| **Compliance Monitoring** | Regulatory tracking, process auditing | OneTrust, GRC Platforms |
| **Competitive Intel** | Market tracking, competitor analysis | News APIs, Patent Databases |
| **Research Synthesis** | Literature processing, hypothesis gen | PubMed, ArXiv, AlphaFold |
| **Code Engineering** | Refactoring, performance, docs | GitHub, SonarQube |
| **Customer Support** | Triage and automated resolution | Zendesk, Intercom |

## 3. Decision Governance Framework

Decisions are tiered based on risk, cost, and reversibility to maintain human supervision.

- **Tier 1: Fully Autonomous**
  - Decisions <$10K, routine operations, low impact.
  - No human approval required.
- **Tier 2: Human-on-the-Loop**
  - Decisions $10K-$100K, material impact, reversible.
  - Auto-execute after a 4-hour timeout if no override is provided.
- **Tier 3: Human-in-the-Loop**
  - Decisions >$100K, strategic shifts, high risk/irreversible.
  - Mandatory human approval before any action.

## 4. Example Orchestration: Market Entry Strategy

**Objective**: "Evaluate and execute entry into the APAC AI Healthcare market by Q3 2026."

1. **Competitive Intelligence Agent**: Analyze local competitors and regulatory hurdles in Japan, Korea, and Singapore.
2. **Research Synthesis Agent**: Analyze clinical trial data requirements for local regulatory approval.
3. **Financial Operations Agent**: Model the 3-year P&L and capital requirements for regional expansion.
4. **Supply Chain Agent**: Optimize logistics for local medical device distribution.
5. **Meta-Agent**: Synthesize into a "Go/No-Go" executive package with 95% confidence intervals.
